# Smart Vivarium Controller

This was my end-of-year project: a **smart vivarium** with both hardware and a web-based control interface.  

The setup included:
- **Arduino R4** code to manage the system  
- Control of a **misting system** (humidity regulation)  
- Sensors for **temperature** and **humidity**  
- A motorized **feeding mechanism**  
- A **web application** to monitor and control everything

## Important Notes
- The Arduino code is **not included** here, I would need to retrieve it from my archives.  
- This is **not the final version** of the project, itâ€™s an earlier stage of development.
If by any chance someone is interested in the **full source code**, feel free to reach out at **[contact@heythomas.dev](mailto:contact@heythomas.dev)**.  
I still have the code on my computer, it just needs some digging up.
